# PROBLEM : 

# write a code that generates a random number and then gives the user 5 chances to guess it 

# SOLUTION : 

import random 

number = random.randint(1,25) 

number_of_guesses=0  # counter 

while number_of_guesses < 5 :
    print('Guess a number between 1 and 25 :  ')
    guess = input()
    guess = int(guess) 
    number_of_guesses +=1
    if guess == number :
        break 
    elif number_of_guesses == 5 :
        break 
    else : 
        print('Try again!')
if guess == number : 
    print ('correct ! you guessed the number in ' + str(number_of_guesses)+'tries!')
    
else : 
    print('you did not guess the number , the number is :' + str(number) )
